"The World Wide Web" by Tim Berners-Lee

The most interesting insights from this article, in my opinion, are not in the explanations of how the W3 works, but in the predictions and aspirations of Berners Lee et. al--perhaps most interestingly, when the authors write, “Whereas one would not wish to see greater proliferation of protocols, the existence of more than one protocol probably allows for the most rapid progress during this phase in the development of the field” (796). This, to me, is the recognition that there will be a winner; that systems will become obsolete and ultimately, only one or a few systems will dominate if the internet is to take hold in the public sphere. This realization, I think, helped W3 refine its goals to focus on accessibility, smooth integration of change, and versatility, whereas Gopher and WAIS seemed to be stuck in narrow-minded paths that weren’t really focused on user experience or contribution.

The other interesting insight I found noteworthy was the statement that “The Web does not yet meet its design goal as being a pool of knowledge that is as easy to update as to read...Most of the information has in fact passed through publishers of system managers of one sort or another.” We’ve definitely reached this point, in my opinion--social media, wikipedia, youtube, soundcloud, blogging platforms...all allow any user the ability to “update the internet” and add whatever they see fit, without any filter or editor or oversight (for better or for worse). We’ve come a long way pretty quickly, and I have no doubt that the web will continue to evolve to see all Berners-Lee’s visions (and more) realized.
