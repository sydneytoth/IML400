The single most important phrase to me in this article was “disempowering the middleman.” This idea, to me, is the most general way to define trends in modern media. <br><br>

In traditional visual art, the middleman has been slowly dying for centuries, and now is all but nonexistent. From the patronage of the church in the middle ages, to the patronage of the uber-wealthy in the following centuries, to the salons of the 18th century, to the museum and gallery systems of the 19th and 20th centuries, there has always been some sort of monetary or social barrier to the entry into the art world. <br><br>

Although decreasing over time, the age of the internet completely smashed these barriers. With free, public access to an audience of 3.3 billion internet users, never before has the average person had such creative power. <br><br>

The aspect of permanence and accessibility of art hosted on the internet is also a huge shift that was heavily discussed in a class on icons that I have taken previously at USC. We discusses how the root value of art has completely been changed since the rise of the internet. While an art piece used to hold value in its singularity and originality, the diffusion of images, writings, music, and other forms over the internet completely changes this. <br><br>

However, I don’t think we can say the value of the original has been completely abolished, as people still willingly travel to see the Mona Lisa and pay for concert tickets to see a band for which they have already downloaded the entire discography. If anything, originality has taken on a mystical value, as we so rarely see or experience the raw, original form of the media we see on the internet that we treat these in-person experiences as something almost spiritual. <br><br>

But the fact that there is now art that is native to the internet again completely uproots our definition of art. If a virus, a webpage, or a program can be considered art, how do we shift our concepts of value away from the physical and into the intangible? How will our experience of art change? How will artists make money off of their art? Should they? These are all questions that I think are going to take over the conversation in the art world (if they haven’t already) and spawn some pretty interesting work in the coming years. <br><br>
