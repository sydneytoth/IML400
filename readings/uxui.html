After reading all these articles, I can’t say I found anything disagreeable or too surprising. There were some tips I found more insightful than others, though.

For example, purposefully compromising short-term memory for the sake of engagement? Realizing that attractive design really just affects first impressions? Interesting (thanks, articles). Writing things in list format with as few words as possible in order to get your point across quickly? Less so. (But yes, still just as important).

But regardless of how obvious or revelatory these ideas seem,  I think they’re all things I could use more consciously to direct my design choices. I don’t really have a design portfolio to speak of, but in my portfolio website project for IML 300, I definitely tried to keep things visually appealing, simple, intuitive, and consistent across pages of my site.
