“Aesthetics of the Internet” Response
Sydney Toth

Reading about these systems of the internet designed to help organize--and in some ways, facilitate--chaos, I automatically thought of social media as a sort of ultimate example of this contradiction.

Social media platforms group users and content (through hashtags, followers, threads), creating a variety of spaces and communities that, in successful cases, are self-sustaining. To facilitate their existence, I think the most significant trait that the most successful platforms share is the fact that they have each created their own sort of media genre, by using existing media in either new ways or combinations. 

For example, Instagram elevated (or some might say dumbed down) the digital photo to a sort of social currency; pictures are given new value as markers/proof/validation of life events, lifestyle, etc. They now come with a quantifiable value system--where more likes is often interpreted as a “better” picture, motivating users to post frequently, amass a large following, and continue, in essence, to feed the beast.

One could almost say that Twitter has given birth to a new genre of writing; tiny snippets of mundane daily updates, press statements from celebrities, comedic micro-scripts, jokes in which the punchline is a picture, GIF, screenshot, etc...it’s a whole new sphere of writing in which the things you might say in a facebook post, short email or text, or journal just don’t translate… 

I’m still sort of skeptical as to the use of “aesthetics” to describe what’s being talked about in this article, though...to me, aesthetics deals with the specific, visible appearance of things, not an abstract take on the front-end of the internet. But then again, I found the article insightful and interesting in its observations on the tensions between chaos and organization on the internet.
